## The idea

In the interest of helping people learn, we must try to focus on not bloating any information shown. Keep it simple, keep it stupid!
Let us also focus on providing example that are easy to understand. Whilst practical applications _might_ have more extensive calculations, for someone that is learning about it they don't really help!
